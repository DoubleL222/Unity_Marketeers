|  NEEDED STUFF  |
------------------


----------
|  SHIP  |
----------
	-> Make the ship start at a random player each round ???? really? Probably not.
	-> (DONE) Count rounds down instead.
	-> (DONE) Make rounds count down for each player individually (so each player can see how many visits he has left; also change the text to "Ship Visits Left")
	-> (DONE) Copy the round indicator to the other side, and make it show the color and number of the player that the ship is moving towards.


------------
|  MARKET  |
------------
	(DONE) -> Do NOT create orders when you turn in an order, but only create 1 new order (if panel is not full) each time the ship leaves a port.


---------------
|  RESOURCES  |
---------------
	

-------------
|  VISUALS  |
-------------
	-> (DONE) Instead of a single ParticleSystem instance for the yield-particles, just instantiate a new prefab each time,
	   so they can overlap time-wise, without having to have a very short life-time.
	-> Fix that the resource MapMarkers keep being set to active.


-----------
|   GUI   |
-----------
	-> (Martin) Distinctive graphics for ALL the trade panels, so you don't have to decifer the UI content, to know which panel you're on.


-----------
|  SOUND  |
-----------
Action:
	-> (DONE, MAYBE REPLACE) Sending small boat
	-> (DONE, MAYBE REPLACE) Ship leaves
	-> (DONE) Separate the gathering sounds from the actual yields.

Trading:
	-> Buying things => Coin sound
	-> Selling things => Chi-ching sound
	-> Add things to trade order => small tick sound
	-> Remove things to trade order => maybe also small tick sound?

--------------------
|  SHIT FOR LATER  |
--------------------
Camera (Jonas):
	-> Make movement only take place in X,Z plane, so translate the Y-movement (from the camera-to-player-vector to the X,Z vector)

Player model:
	-> Another player model, maybe?
	-> Animate player model

------------------------------
|  PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS  |
------------------------------
Environment
	-> (Martin) Bake lights
	-> (Martin) Remove objects (depends on the performance)
