IDEAS:
	-> How to make grinding/running around more fun:
		-> Abilities
			-> Dash (get around faster)
			-> Jump (so you can get to resources you cannot get without jumping)
		-> Power-ups you can buy from the ship, or a store on the island.
			-> Gather faster
			-> Gather more per yield
			-> Resources respawn faster
		-> Buying items
			-> E.g. grind wood faster for an amount of time.
			-> More resources per yield

	-> How to make gameplay deeper:
		-> Buy and/or upgrade buildings, to:
			-> Continuously yield resources
			-> Give more resources per yield
	-> How to expand the game loop:
		-> Adding to the loop with a mechanic which would bring more interaction between the players
			-> Perhaps a combat mechanic (maybe hiering pirate ship to attack/rob other players)


IDEAS TO MAKE GATHERING AND RUNNING FROM ISLANDS TO THE PORT A SMALLER PART OF THE GAME:
	-> Cut out the market completely
	-> You can send your trade boat from anywhere on your island
	-> You can do trades, market and fill orders from anywhere on your island
	-> You can do trades, market and fill orders from anywhere on your island ALL THE TIME (no ship)
	-> Increase the amount of time that the ship is at each player
	-> Reverse the goal, so there's a winner
	-> Make it co-op, with all four players on the same island, trying to do <insert goal>
		-> Build a successful settlement, like in Heroes of Might and Magic where you select a building type, and it just spawns at a specific position
